These all assume you're following the docs:

A few scripts I find handy to do some Satellite Connector things quickly. 
Note this is a work in progress. 

I show here how to do both configmap and a quick and dirty just assign the values (the APIKEY one). 
Ideally you use configmap with some proper secrets manager but there's use cases to just assign the values too.
